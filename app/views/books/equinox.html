        <p>What do people want in their lives? Is what they want, indeed, what they need? Do we need high drama to bring about monumental changes in our lives or does it happen easily and imperceptibly? These are the simple, important questions that Equinox the novel explores.</p>
        <p>‘Equinox’ is Indus Books’ attempt to maintain its toehold in the market. Equinox becomes the means for six people, neither terribly clever nor horribly ambitious, to earn a modest sum of money, honestly. These nice, regular people write for a short story contest and this process changes their lives in interesting ways. Hailing from diverse backgrounds, they all learn a lot about themselves in a few months. They look life in the eye, test the road not taken and emerge winners in different ways. That mind can overpower matter, is what we learn. We see the characters in the process of negotiating the U-pin curve.</p>
        <p>‘Equinox’ attempts to carry its readers through the journey each of the ensemble characters takes in their attempts to bring richness and colour as well as meaning into their individual lives, be it financial or psychological. Their journeys are indeed, interesting to read as they attempt to put their written creative efforts on paper for a short story competition to win a cash prize given by a publishing house. We not only get to read their individual journey, but also get to peek into their individual stories.</p>
        <p>Madhuri manages to capture the humanity of her characters and infuse feelings into them, which we can identify with at some level or the other. She has etched characters who are really very us, very ordinary along with being extraordinary and deal with life situations like all of us do.</p>
        <p>This heart-warming book seeks to entertain even as it gently connects the dots to reveal the universality of the human condition. Know the characters – The characters in the book are varied not only in terms of their backgrounds and ages, but also their motivations.</p>
